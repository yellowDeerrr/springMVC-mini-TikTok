# springMVC-mini-TikTok
In this project I do web-app on SpringMVC + hibernate with thymelaf

You can create new account with avatar /createAccount,
then you can create video /createNewVideo with .img or .mp4 e.t.c. and set name video

If you go to /foryou this will redirect you on
/@name_account/video/idVideo - this url find video by script (random video)
On this page you can like video, see next video or view profile creater this video /@name_account - here you will see which video user like
/@name_account/video/idVideo In right corner is search feed which will redirect you on /search?s=what_you_search.
